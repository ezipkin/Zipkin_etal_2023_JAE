# Case Study 1: Spatial distributions of forest birds across the Northeastern United States

This repository contains all code, data, and documents related to case study 1 in which we model the distributions of 27 interior forest birds across the Northeastern United States using an integrated community occupancy model. The directory is split into the following structure. Each sub-directory contains its own README file with details on each of the files in that specific sub-directory.

+ `code`: contains all scripts for data processing, running the integrated community occupancy model in both `spOccupancy` and `NIMBLE`, and processing of the results.
+ `data`: contains processed data used for the analysis.

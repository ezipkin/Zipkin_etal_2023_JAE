This directory contains MCMC sample objects for use in generating the relative abundance index and plot shown in Figure 3 in the manuscript. 

1. `beta-comm-samples-*-chain.rda`: MCMC samples of the community-level mean effects for three different chains, where each chain is stored separately and the number replaces the `*` wildcard in the file name. 
2. `beta-samples-*-chain.rda`: MCMC samples of the species-level effects for three different chains. 
3. `beta-star-samples-*-chain.rda`: MCMC samples of the species=level random effects for three different chains.

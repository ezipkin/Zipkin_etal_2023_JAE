# example_data

This folder contains example input files for each of the three data types analyzed in the multispecies integrated population model case study. This includes annual population count data, capture-recapture data, and productivity data for a hypothetical community of 10 species over a 10-year time period. These data were generated as the first of 100 simulated datasets using functions in the R package `IPMbook` by Schaub, KÃ©ry and Meredith (2022). The code to format these specific files for analysis is not provided.

1. `example_age_first_capture_data.csv`: provides the age of first capture for every individual of each specues.
2. `example_captures_data.csv`: provides the capture history of every individual of each species over the 10-year study period.
3. `example_populationcount_data.csv`: provides the annual population counts of each species in each year of the 10-year study period.
4. `example_productivity_data.csv`: provides the annual number of observed juveniles (age 1 in our pre-breeding census) and surveyed broods for each species in each year of the 10-year study period.
